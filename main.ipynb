It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n",

These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—in order to \"learn\" from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize the accuracy. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. It's used across industries for various applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.\n",

Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Deep Learning, on the other hand, is a subset of Machine Learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Deep Learning models are able to automatically learn features and patterns in data and are especially useful when applying AI to complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
